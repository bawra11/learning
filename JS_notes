Javascript is a programming language created for the web.
HTML & CSS are markup languages. Markup languages are used to describe and define elements within a document.
JavaScript is a programming language. Programming languages are used to communicate instructions to a machine.
Programming languages can be used to control the behavior of a machine and to express algorithms.
Javascript was made in just 10 days
Recent verions of javascript are referenced by their ECMAScript like ES5, ES6, ES2016
Use Google Chrome's developer tools to access the Javascript console.
link to shortcuts for developer tools: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts
Developer tools are often used as a sandbox (a place to test your code without any long term consequences.). You can use it to debug problems you've run into or test a new piece of code.
console.log is used to display content to the JavaScript console.
All major browsers come with built in javascript engines: this allows the browsers to run and execute javascript code.
cosole.log() writes a message on the console.

JS code must be inserted between <script> tags with "src" attribute as the path if code is written in seperate file.

To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
Changing the "innerHTML" property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.
Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML. The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
Using window.alert() you can use an alert box to display data.
For debugging purposes, you can use the console.log() method to display data.

Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter.

What is JavaScript Bitwise Operators?

JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.
JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results. Like:
var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
will give output, 20Volvo however,
var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
will give output, Volvo164.

JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. Type of Js array is "object".

JavaScript objects are written with curly braces. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digis, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}.
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

The this Keyword
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
};
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function. In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
When used alone, this refers to the Global object. In a  browser the Global object is [object Window].

Common HTML Events:
onchange	         An HTML element has been changed
onclick	           The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	       The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	       The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	         The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	           The browser has finished loading the pageonchange	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	           The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	       The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	       The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	         The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	           The browser has finished loading the page

JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes or associative arrays.

The join() method also joins all array elements into a string. It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator. Like Array.join(" / ").

If you are repeating the else if statement, where each condition is based on the same value, use a switch statement.
 Here we do not have conditional statements. Instead, we switch which piece of code is executed based on value.

Syntax:
 switch (option){
   case 1:
     console.log("You selected option 1");
     break;
   case 2:
     console.log("You selected option 2");
     break;
   case 3:
     console.log("You selected option 3");
     break;
   case 4:
     console.log("You selected option 4");
     break;
   default:
     console.log("This is the default output");
 }

The break statement prevents the control from "falling through" to the other case clauses.
The default case is executed when none of the cases match the value of the switch expression.
You can also use "output += something" in the place of console.log to take advantage of the falling through characteristic of switch statements.

In JS the var is scoped to the nearest function, and that is available anywhere inside that function.
